A guide on going freelance with some helpful advice.

<!--more-->

<hr><div class="[ sidebar ] [ article-with-sponsors ]"><div class="[ post ] [ flow ]"><p>It‚Äôs rolling onto 2 years since I went back independent and fully freelance, but over the 4 years I‚Äôve been working in design and the web, I‚Äôve probably done around half of that as a freelancer in some capacity.</p><p>Lots of people are experiencing either redundancies or work issues at the moment and although, at the time of writing, we are in a global pandemic: <strong>now is a great time to go freelance</strong>.</p><p>In this article, I‚Äôm going to share with you some tips that have I have learned from my experience and freelancing pros. I hope by the end that you will feel more confident about going freelance. I must point out that the advice is mainly centered around working with clients, rather than say, doing contract development work, but hopefully you‚Äôll get some benefit if that‚Äôs you. Let‚Äôs dig in.</p><h2 id="heading-freedom">Freedom</h2><p>The ‚ÄúF‚Äù in Freelance stands for <strong>‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù</strong>. It doesn‚Äôt really, but freedom is exactly what you get when you go freelance. This freedom for me has enabled two key things: ownership of my time and flexibility to diversify what I do.</p><p>I started working as a contract developer and freelancer in September 2019 For at least 12 months after that, I worked in a similar role, as a freelancer: working only with clients and contracting for works, along with a brief content writing and graphic design.</p><p>Because the work was quite steady, I didn‚Äôt need to do much admin and business development stuff, either. This is a very valid way of going about freelance and I think it could appeal to someone who is comfortable working almost like they have a day job. The reason you work a lot less time like this as a freelancer is simple: no company bullshit. You are the boss of your own time and I promise you: you will make so much more of the time you do spend working.</p><p>Back to flexibility again, because being freelance gives you <em>lots</em> of that. I still work for clients, but a lot less so, so I can focus on study and work on my side projects. Granted, I‚Äôve worked a hell of a lot more this year than last year, but the hope is by next year, I can work <strong>even less</strong> than a typical 10-4 day, thanks to the work I‚Äôm doing now.</p><p>Because I have the flexibility as a freelancer, that is possible too. The key is that flexibility completely empowers you to work how <strong>you want to work</strong>.</p><h2 id="heading-get-comfortable-with-money">Get comfortable with money</h2><p>There‚Äôs two parts to focus on here: being comfortable talking about money and being comfortable with your personal finances.</p><p>I‚Äôll start with talking about money. You <strong>have</strong> to be comfortable talking about money with clients. In fact, when a new enquiry lands in my inbox, <strong>the first thing I do is ask them what their budget is</strong>.</p><p>So much time is wasted by being coy about money. A client needs to have a budget to hire you and let me tell you, if they refuse to tell you what that budget is, <strong>that‚Äôs a massive red flag</strong>. That refusal could be down to mistrust on their end, though‚Äîthey might think you‚Äôll use that budget to send them an over-inflated quote. I‚Äôd tackle that by saying something like this:</p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúIn order to work out what we can achieve on this project, we really need an idea of budget. Creating an estimate for you without this knowledge of our limitations would be a futile exercise because I have no idea what the limits of this engagement are.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p>The second part on this section is your own finances. <strong>You need to know exactly how much money you need to survive every month</strong></p><p>An easy strategy to start with is try to earn your <strong>current full-time salary</strong>‚Äîespecially if you are a sole trader (we‚Äôll get to that). It‚Äôs a solid approach into freelance.</p><p>Moving on from that approach: try to <strong>double your salary</strong>. This is because building up a buffer will make life a <em>lot</em> easier on a number of fronts. Firstly, it‚Äôs ‚Äúget fucked‚Äù money. What I mean by that is if a client turns out to be a nightmare, you can tell them to get fucked, knowing that you have a buffer to support you. This is useful for if your client turns out to be doing very unethical worth, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/7/30/20728147/tech-company-ice-contracts-foia-microsoft-palantir-concur-dell">working with ICE</a>, for example. That empowerment is everything.</p><p>This leads nicely in to calculating how much you charge for your work. The first point on this is <strong>never work for free</strong>. I've been there done that and learned my lesson. If a client demands free spec work, bin them off and focus on other new clients instead.</p><p>In terms of how much to charge: this comes down to knowing how much you need. Get your monthly outgoings spreadsheet, take the total and <strong>triple it</strong>. ‚ÄúWhy the hell?!?‚Äù, they scream. We triple it because there‚Äôs a darn good chance you will experience <strong>very quiet spells</strong>, so charging a lot more for your work when you have it builds up your buffer to get you through these times. You get more ammo to tell awful clients to fuck off, and getting to that goal of earning double.</p><h2 id="heading-get-good-at-organising-your-time">Get good at organising your time</h2><p>Those who know me well, know that I organise everything to within an inch of its life. I do all of this organising in <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/things-3/id904237743">Things</a>. Notion is the main hub of planning, scheduling and client communications (yep, you read that right). Things is what I use to manage my tasks. I did previously do this in Notion and before that, in a bullet journal, but now, Notion is the main bullet journal and Things does its job well for me.</p><p></p>
<img width="100%" src="/images/freelance-1.jpg" alt="Task Organiser"/>
<p>I prioritise my tasks with üö® P1 and üî• P2, with the rest being optional for the day.</p></figcaption></figure><p></p><p>I‚Äôm not going to tell you how to plan and organise in this post. Maybe I will go into more detail if there‚Äôs an appetite for it, but the main theme is however you want to do it, just do it. Being disorganised, when you are your own boss will surely be a disaster and even having a notepad with a todo list on it is better than nothing.</p><p>I strongly recommend that you schedule what you are working on each day in advance. I‚Äôd still give yourself a bit of flexibility because you might not be in the mood to say, do some creative work once you wake up, but planning time in advance is really helpful not just to keep track of where your projects are, but also where your next availability is, which leads us nicely to the next section.</p><p></p><figure><img width="100%" src="/images/freelance-2.jpg" alt="My weekly schedule in Notion, broken into time blocks" loading="lazy"><figcaption class="wrapper"><p>I break the morning and afternoon into 3 slots then book my time around those.</p></figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><figure><img width="100%" src="/images/freelance-3.jpg" alt="My roadmap in Notion which is like a kanban for the whole year" loading="lazy"><figcaption class="wrapper"><p>Roadmapping your time like this is super helpful to get an idea of what‚Äôs coming up and where you can squeeze clients in.</p></figcaption></figure><p></p><h2 id="heading-don&#39;t-wait-to-find-work">Don‚Äôt wait to find work</h2><p>Now that you are super organised, you‚Äôll know on your schedule where the gaps are. Don‚Äôt wait to fill them: start putting feelers out for projects immediately.</p><p>If I see a gap that I want to fill come up, I send out a tweet along the lines of this:</p><blockquote><p>I‚Äôve got a bit of availability coming up, so if you need some design or front-end development work, give me a shout and we‚Äôll get it booked in!</p></blockquote><p>I keep the timing vague because all I‚Äôm doing here is gathering a couple of leads. The tweets will often lead to nothing, but it does plant the idea that you have availability in people‚Äôs heads. If someone knows of work coming up a month later, they might think: ‚ÄúOh, I saw Shivam had availability coming up. I should recommend them‚Äù.</p><p>Being organised with this stuff gives you flexibility for this sort of chance recommendation to happen. If you wait right until the last minute to land work, there‚Äôs a good chance that your tweet/instagram/mailshot will land nothing and you will go into panic mode (unless you have a large buffer). This is often when you‚Äôll snatch at a project and land a nightmare client.</p><p>I won‚Äôt tell you where to find work because that varies a lot, but my advice is to network in your industry and get to know people. Building a reputation is so important because people will recommend you to potential new clients if you‚Äôre a pleasure to work with and do a good job. I get most of my client work via a recommendation from someone else now.</p><p>That doesn‚Äôt fix the problem of how to land that first project, though. I think for that, tweeting that you‚Äôre going freelance (I‚Äôll always RT if you send me the tweet) and alerting people in your network will probably get you that first freelance job.</p><h2 id="heading-contracts-insurance-and-deposits">Contracts, insurance and deposits</h2><p>Contracts and insurance are so important. Insurance especially so if you‚Äôre not going to incorporate as a company (still get insurance if you do). If you are writing code for clients, <strong>please insure yourself</strong>, because at some point, you probably will mess up.</p><p>Contracts achieve two things in my experience. They build trust between client and vendor (that's you). A contract could be really simple, like <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer">Andy Clarke‚Äôs Contract Killer</a>. I would recommend getting something a bit more bulletproof for very large projects though. This is where I would turn to a legal professional.</p><p>Lastly, <strong>get at least 50% of your project budget up-front</strong> if you are charging a flat rate and if not, get some form of deposit. There are only a <em>tiny</em> handful of clients that I won‚Äôt take a deposit off, only because I trust them a lot. Normally, that deposit has to be in my bank before I even lift a finger because if the client suddenly decides they are going to be bad payers (it happens a lot unfortunately), you have a good chunk of money still. Remember when I said charge 3X what you need? You‚Äôd be pretty thankful for that right now if it all goes pear shaped.</p></h2><h2>Get Good at Communication</h2><p>The last part of this post is a tip on communication. Get good at emailing. I know I run most stuff through Notion, but the same principles apply, even in there.</p><p>Short, concise communication is the best way: trust me. I‚Äôll be <em>extremely opinionated</em> on this because being concise (often blunt) works very well for me. When I write an email, it‚Äôs extremely short and to the point and will very likely feature bullet points. It has to be readable in less than a minute. This means that you should probably remove pleasantries such as the infamous ‚ÄúI hope you are well‚Äù or worse: ‚ÄúI hope this email reaches you well‚Äù‚Äîwritten as if the email was delivered by a donkey, via a mountain range...</p><p>The reason to keep things short is that <strong>people are busy</strong>. You might feel like you are being polite, riddling a email with pleasantries, but really, you‚Äôre probably being the opposite, taking up their time. If I see a wall of text in my inbox, I‚Äôll set it aside until I can be arsed reading it, which in a lot of cases, is never. Getting good at writing short emails is something that happens over time though, so get practicing now!</p><p>Lastly, meetings are a time-sink. I often joke that I am a professional meeting-dodger because I <em>hate them</em>. Granted, some things require a meeting, but most stuff can be done with written communication. I actually like to record screen-casts, which you can <a href="https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/screencasting-the-secret-sauce-for-less-time-wasted-in-meetings/">read up on here</a>. Also, don‚Äôt join your client‚Äôs chat group: they aren‚Äôt paying you for 24/7 support!!</p><h2 id="heading-wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><p>If you are thinking of going freelance: <strong>do it</strong>. I believe in you!</p><p>Take it easy and good luck if this is the start of your freelancing career üôÇ</p></div>
